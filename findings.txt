Summarise your findings here (see specification).

The board that is impossible to solve is "mystery2".

The board that is "extremely hard" to solve is "mystery1".
The board that is "hard" to solve is "mystery3".

This is because mystery1 has more possible values that can be placed
in the cells at the start. Also, when being solved, mystery1 required
more board updates (i.e. more nodes were opened that did not lead to
the solution) and a longer execution time. Because all of these
factors are indicators of difficulty (this is also seen when these
statistics are compared between easy, medium, hard and extremely
hard), we can conclude that mystery1 is harder than mystery2.
