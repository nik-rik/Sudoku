Summarise your findings here (see specification).

The board that is impossible to solve is "mystery2".

mystery1.dat test statistics:
Possible values from outset: 227
Number of board updates: 421546
Execution time (nanoseconds):152845757

mystery3.dat test statistics:
Possible values from outset: 222
Number of board updates: 14133
Execution time (nanoseconds):4442880


The board that is "extremely hard" to solve is "mystery1".
The board that is "hard" to solve is "mystery3".

This is because mystery1 has more possible values that can be placed
in the cells at the start. Also, when being solved, mystery1 required
more board updates (i.e. more nodes were opened that did not lead to
the solution) and a longer execution time (even though these are
imperefect measures as the medium board is higher in these
respects). However, when viewed in aggregate, we can conclude that
mystery1 is harder than mystery2.
